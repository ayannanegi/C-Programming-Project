# C-Programming-Project
I'll be making a To-Do List Application project through basic C language skills (with Priority &amp; Deadlines) which includes following points • Add, update, delete tasks. • Assign priority levels (High/Medium/Low). • Set deadlines with date and time. • Display pending vs completed tasks. • Save tasks persistently to a file.
